## 🚀 Next Steps: Vector Store

### Phase 4: Vector Store Implementation

**What we'll build:**
1. Document chunking (500-1000 tokens)
2. Generate embeddings (OpenAI/local model)
3. Store in pgvector
4. Semantic search functions
5. Retrieval testing

**Time estimate:** 45 minutes

**Prerequisites:**
- ✅ Knowledge base created (done!)
- ✅ PostgreSQL with pgvector (done!)
- 🔜 Embedding model (OpenAI API key or local model)
- 🔜 Python chunking script
- 🔜 Embedding generation script

**Technologies:**
- **Chunking:** LangChain or custom Python
- **Embeddings:** OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (1536 dims) or Sentence-Transformers (local)
- **Storage:** pgvector (already enabled)
- **Retrieval:** Cosine similarity search

---

## ✅ Verification Checklist

Before moving to vector store, verify:

- [ ] All 10 documents created
- [ ] Folder structure created
- [ ] Files placed in correct folders
- [ ] README.md in root knowledge_base/
- [ ] Documents are markdown (.md) format
- [ ] File names match exactly
- [ ] Content is complete (no truncation)

## 🎯 RAG System Integration

### How These Documents Will Be Used

**Step 1: Chunking**
- Break each document into 500-1000 token chunks
- Maintain context with overlap (100 tokens)
- Preserve section headers as metadata

**Step 2: Embedding**
- Generate vector embeddings for each chunk
- Store in `vector_store.documents` table
- Include metadata (doc name, section, product)

**Step 3: Retrieval**
- User asks question
- Convert question to embedding
- Find most similar chunks (cosine similarity)
- Return top 5-10 relevant chunks

**Step 4: LLM Response**
- Pass retrieved chunks to LLM as context
- LLM generates answer grounded in docs
- Cite sources (document + section)

### Expected Performance

**Retrieval Accuracy:**
- Common questions: >95%
- Complex queries: >85%
- Edge cases: >70%

**Response Time:**
- Embedding generation: <100ms
- Vector search: <50ms
- LLM generation: 1-3 seconds
- **Total:** <5 seconds
