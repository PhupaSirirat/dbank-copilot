## Interest Rates & Calculation

### Rate Determination Factors
1. **Credit Score**
   - Excellent (750+): Base rate
   - Good (700-749): Base + 1%
   - Fair (650-699): Base + 2%
   - Average (600-649): Base + 3%

2. **Loan Tenure**
   - 6-12 months: -0.5%
   - 13-36 months: Base rate
   - 37-60 months: +0.5%

3. **Customer Relationship**
   - Premium customers: -0.5%
   - Existing loan customers (good history): -0.25%

### EMI Calculation
**Formula:** [P × R × (1+R)^N] / [(1+R)^N-1]

Where:
- P = Principal amount
- R = Monthly interest rate (Annual rate / 12 / 100)
- N = Tenure in months

**Example:** 100,000 THB at 10% for 24 months
- EMI = 4,614 THB/month
