- Cleans ticket data (lowercase, trim)
- Adds derived fields:
  - `is_resolved` - Boolean flag
  - `satisfaction_level` - Categorized (satisfied/neutral/unsatisfied)
  - `resolution_speed` - Categorized (fast/normal/slow)

**Key Fields:**
- All original ticket fields (cleaned)
- Plus 3 new derived fields

**Used by:** `mart_ticket_analytics`

  - Year/month/quarter
  - Root cause
  - Category
  - Product category
- Calculates KPIs:
  - Total tickets & percentages
  - Open ticket percentage

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ **mart_churned_customers** (Churn Prediction)

**Purpose:** Identify at-risk customers with churn scores

**Materialization:** Table

**Location:** `marts.mart_churned_customers`

**What it does:**
- Analyzes customer activity:
  - Last login date
  - Login frequency
  - Product holdings
  - Support tickets
- Calculates churn metrics:
  - `is_churned_30d` - No login 30+ days
  - `is_churned_90d` - No login 90+ days
  - `churn_risk_score` - 0-100 scale
  - `churn_risk_level` - active/low/medium/high/critical
  - `estimated_clv` - Customer lifetime value

**Key Use Cases:**
- "Churned customers in last 30/90 days" ‚úÖ
- Retention campaigns
- High-value at-risk customers
- Churn prediction modeling

**Business Value:**
- Proactive retention
- Prioritize high-CLV customers
- Track churn trends by segment

**Powers:** MCP tool for churn SQL queries

## üîÑ How Models Work Together

```
User Question: "Top 5 root causes last month with % open tickets"
    ‚Üì
Query: SELECT * FROM marts.mart_top_root_causes 
       WHERE created_year = 2025 AND created_month = 10
       ORDER BY total_tickets DESC LIMIT 5
    ‚Üì
Result: Instant! (already aggregated)
```

```
User Question: "Show me v1.2 tickets affecting Digital Lending"
    ‚Üì
Query: SELECT * FROM marts.mart_ticket_analytics
       WHERE is_v12_related = true 
       AND product_type = 'Digital Lending'
    ‚Üì
Result: Full context for each ticket
```

```
User Question: "Premium customers churned in last 30 days"
    ‚Üì
Query: SELECT * FROM marts.mart_churned_customers
       WHERE customer_segment = 'Premium'
       AND is_churned_30d = true
       ORDER BY estimated_clv DESC
    ‚Üì
Result: Priority list for retention team
```

## üé® Model Design Patterns

### **Staging Layer (stg_)**
- **Pattern:** Clean & standardize
- **Materialization:** Views (always fresh)
- **No business logic:** Just data quality

### **Mart Layer (mart_)**
- **Pattern:** Business-ready tables
- **Materialization:** Tables (performance)
- **Full context:** All joins done
- **Calculate once, query many**

### **Naming Convention**
- `stg_` = Staging (raw ‚Üí clean)
- `mart_` = Mart (analysis-ready)
- `_analytics` = Detailed fact table
- `_top_` = Aggregated KPI
- `_churned_` = Specialized analysis

## üöÄ Performance Characteristics

| Model | Rows | Refresh Time | Query Speed |
|-------|------|--------------|-------------|
| stg_tickets | 15K | Instant (view) | Fast |
| mart_ticket_analytics | 15K | ~2-3 sec | Fast |
| mart_top_root_causes | ~200 | ~2 sec | Very Fast ‚ö° |
| mart_churned_customers | ~10K | ~2 sec | Fast |

**Total dbt run time:** ~6-8 seconds for all 4 models

## üß™ Testing Coverage

Each model has data quality tests:
- **Uniqueness** - Primary keys
- **Not null** - Critical fields
- **Relationships** - Foreign keys valid
- **Accepted values** - Status fields
- **Custom logic** - Business rules

**Run tests:** `dbt test`

## üìà Sample Queries

### **Query 1: Top Root Causes**
```sql
SELECT 
    root_cause_name,
    category_name,
    total_tickets,
    pct_of_period,
    pct_open
FROM marts.mart_top_root_causes
WHERE created_year = 2025 
    AND created_month = 10
ORDER BY total_tickets DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### **Query 2: v1.2 Impact**
```sql
SELECT 
    product_type,
    COUNT(*) as v12_tickets,
    AVG(resolution_time_hours) as avg_resolution
FROM marts.mart_ticket_analytics
WHERE is_v12_related = true
GROUP BY product_type;
```

### **Query 3: High-Value Churn Risk**
```sql
SELECT 
    customer_segment,
    COUNT(*) as at_risk_customers,
    SUM(estimated_clv) as clv_at_risk
FROM marts.mart_churned_customers
WHERE churn_risk_level IN ('high', 'critical')
GROUP BY customer_segment;
```
